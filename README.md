## Documentation

This application takes input values from the user as gender, age, weight and height and accordingly displays the BMI value for the given inputs. There is a lot scope for improvement in the application. Feel free the make changes according to your own taste. Try to define a logic to calculate the BMI value of females too, because the current logic does'nt specify the BMI value for the females in a precise way.
