## Documentation

This project uses a Flame Sensor,a Smoke Sensor (MQ-2), a 16x2 LCD Display, a Relay, and a GSM Module (GSM 900-D). The purpose of this project is to alert the users if Flame/Smoke is detected in the kitchen and deploy the necessary actions required to prevent the mishap, such as activate an Alarm System and sending a text SMS to the user to alert them. The system also automatically turns off the gas valve to prevent the fire from further spreading and also cuts off the electricity mains.

There is a lot scope for improvement in the project. Feel free the make changes according to your own taste.
